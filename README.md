# PersonnalUsage
Just a reposity for my Personnal Usage (but can be used for another person)

My first deposits are an improved version of Impostor's PufferPanel models
My second is a python script that automatically uploads several manga images to translate (from [this project](https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator)) using [this url](https://touhou.ai/imgtrans/).  -- made with selenium .
