# PersonnalUsage
Just a reposity for my Personnal Usage (but can be used for another person)

- My first deposits are an improved version of Impostor's PufferPanel models

- My second is a python script that automatically uploads several manga images to translate (from [this project](https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator)) using [this url](https://touhou.ai/imgtrans/).  -- made with selenium .

- The third is just a project for automatise minecraft vote and bypassing capchat for free but not really work 

- The fourth is a twitch bot that allows you to link a clash royale account with your twitch account and adds a command to know the trophies of a viewer who has linked his account (I used mongodb to practice)
